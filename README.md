# No Projectile Boosting
This plugin is made to stop projectile boosting on your server (shooting yourself with a bow or rod or snowball to boost yourself forwards)

## Features
* Customize what projectiles to block
* Custom messages when somebody tries to projectile boost

## Installation
* Make a Minecraft 1.8 Spigot server (use Java version 17)
* Place the plugin jar inside of your plugins folder
* Restart your server
* And last of all to customize the plugin go to plugins/NoBowBoosts/config.yml

## Notes
This is a Java 17 project. The build system used is Maven. And I probably will never update this plugin.
